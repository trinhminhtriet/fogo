It seems like you are running `fogo` for the first time. To use `fogo` for changing directories, you need to make a small addition to your shell configuration. For example, for Bash/Zsh, you have to put the following in your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`:

{}

For other shells and additional details such as configuring `fogo`, see the `README`.

Press `y` to confirm that you have updated your shell configuration, or any other key to cancel.
